    <h2 class="content-title" id="experiences">Why I'm Doing It</h2>
      <p>As of right now I see myself becoming some sort of tech developer, and that seems like a realistic outcome so I've decided to pursue that. I've always been a person that has way too many interests and has trouble balancing them all. So one function of this website is to help me keep track of what the bigger picture is.</p>
